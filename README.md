> It is impossible to estimate the real size of the Deep Web, because
> the majority of data is not accessible to the casual user, and new
> content is always being added. Michael Bergman, the founder of the
> intelligence company BrightPlanet, compared searching on the Internet
> to dragging a net across the surface of the ocean: search engines are
> able to analyze the surface content but fail to recognize that there
> is a wealth of information hidden below. In a 2001 study, Bergman
> hypothesized that the overall content in the Deep Web consisted of
> about 7.5 petabytes. The Deep Web thus could have been 4,000–5,000
> times larger than the so-called Surface Web at that time, and it was
> estimated to be growing at an exponential rate.

*ARPANET :*

> Military origins of Deep Web – Like other areas of the Internet, the
> Deep Web began to grow with help from the U.S. military, which sought
> a way to communicate with intelligence assets and Americans stationed
> abroad without being detected. Paul Syverson, David Goldschlag and
> Michael Reed, mathematicians at the Naval Research Laboratory, began
> working on the concept of “onion routing” in 1995. Their research soon
> developed into The Onion Router project, better known as Tor, in 1997.
> 
> The U.S. Navy released the Tor code to the public in 2004, and in 2006
> a group of developers formed the Tor Project and released the service
> currently in use.

[ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET)

> In September 1984 work was completed on restructuring the ARPANET
> giving U.S. military sites their own Military Network (MILNET) for
> unclassified defense department communications. Controlled
> gateways connected the two networks. The combination was called the
> Defense Data Network (DDN). Separating the civil and military
> networks reduced the 113-node ARPANET by 68 nodes. The MILNET later
> became the NIPRNet.

> The Deep Web
> 
> Here's the easiest way to think about the Deep Web: It's all the data
> behind firewalls. Think user databases, business intranets, web
> archives, password-protected websites, etc.
> 
> By some estimates, this part of the internet is estimated to be 400 to
> 500 times as large as the Surface Web.
> 
> Sometimes you will hear the term Deep Web used interchangeably with
> "Dark Web," but they aren't really the same thing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**DARKWEB :** 

> The Dark Web The Dark Web actually refers to a set of accessible,
> albeit anonymously hosted, websites that exist within the Deep Web.
> 
> Because these websites are not indexed by normal search engines, you
> can access them only with special software that disguises your IP
> address.
> 
> The most common software used to access the the Dark Web is The Onion
> Browser, referred to as TOR.
> 
> The Dark Web is much smaller than the Deep Web, and it's made up of
> numerous types of sites. But it's perhaps most popular for its
> anonymous marketplaces that often sell illegal products like drugs or
> weapons.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------***TOR:***

*TOR WORKING PROCESS :*
---

> How Tor works
> 
> Tor works like a circuit, taking an individual’s Internet connection
> and redirecting it through different connection points (or “nodes”)
> all over the world before delivering it to the desired website.
> Peeling back the layers of that “onion” becomes more difficult with
> every additional node, so both Tor’s strength and popularity soared
> when the Electronic Frontier Foundation released a public version of
> the software in 2004.
> 
> Tor software isn’t the only way to access the Deep Web, but it’s by
> far the most efficient and user-friendly. Its growth has also made the
> Deep Web more accessible, giving users who simply sought anonymity an
> unexpected level of access to everything from drug bazaars to crisis
> counseling.
> 
> “It’s wedded to the idea of the origins of the Internet, around the
> intertwining of the cryptography and open-source ethos and
> philosophy,” said Alex Winter, the director behind the 2013
> documentary “Downloaded” and an upcoming Deep Web film. “It’s largely
> just what’s under the hood of the Internet. That space has been
> penetrated by people who want to remain anonymous and hide their
> identity online.”

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------***ANONIMITY:***

*TOR IS GOOD BUT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO PUT MORE LAYERS OF SECURITY TO STAY ANONYMOUS (this list is not exhaustive) :*
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- FIREWALL______________________ 'config it right'
- VPN = Virtual private network______'choose a good one'
- DNS = Domain name system_______    'change it'
- Proxy’s and proxy servers__________'choose them right'
- VPS = Virtual private server_________'config it right'



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------***ONION:***


*HOW TO NAVIGATE THROUGH :*
-----------------------

You navigate on tor through the [onion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing) link.


Here is a print screen of the most known webpage on the tor network where we can see the onion link : 

![Onion-link](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5724ee301bbee056721dd394/t/58c1a76f20099ecd41dfc514/1489086513683/)



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------***BITCOINS:***


*HOW TO BUY STUFF :*
------------------


> [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) is a cryptocurrency and a digital payment system
> invented by an unknown programmer, or a group of programmers, under
> the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It was released as open-source software
> in 2009.

- BUY BITCOINS ON A P2P MARKET PLACE (Localbitcoins, ...) OR ON A MARKET EXCHANGE (ex: Bitstam, Coindesk, ...)

- MAKE A WALLET : [Blockchain](https://www.blockchain.com/) for example 

- TRANSFERT YOUR FUNDS FROM THE MARKET PLACE TO YOUR BITCOINS WALLET

- GO AND BUY STUFF !! xD take care a lot of ScamS


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------***BITCOINS:***


*A LITTLE WORD OR TWO ON BLOCKCHAIN :*
-----------------------------


> A blockchain [blockchain](https://www.blockchain.com/) – originally block chain – is a distributed database that
> maintains a continuously growing list of records, called blocks,
> secured from tampering and revision. Each block contains a timestamp
> and a link to a previous block. By design, blockchains are inherently
> resistant to modification of the data — once recorded, the data in a
> block cannot be altered retroactively. Through the use of a
> peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server, a
> blockchain database is managed autonomously. Blockchains are "an open,
> distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties
> efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. The ledger itself
> can also be programmed to trigger transactions automatically."
> 
> Blockchains are secure by design and an example of a distributed
> computing system with high byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized
> consensus can therefore be achieved with a blockchain. This makes
> blockchains suitable for the recording of events, medical records, and
> other records management activities, identity management, transaction
> processing, and documenting provenance.
> 
> The first blockchain was conceptualised by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008
> and implemented the following year as a core component of the digital
> currency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all
> transactions. The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the
> first digital currency to solve the double spending problem, without
> the use of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design
> has been the inspiration for other applications.
